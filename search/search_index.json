If you're on the same wifi or hotspot network, it should be easy. Start playing a game, open the pause menu and press \"Host Multiplayer Game\" button. This will make your game available to everyone in the same network. To join this game from another device, click Play > Join Game. If another player is hosting, the game should pop up in the list of servers. I can't find my friend's multiplayer game! If you are sure that you are on the same network, and you still can't find their game, considering using a wifi hotspot instead of a public network. Some public wifi networks simply do not allow server discovery. If you're using a wifi hotspot and you still can't find a friend's game, you could try connecting directly via IP. Instead of looking for the game, find the internal IP of the hosting device (look up how to find it for the specific device you're using), and have the other player type in that IP in the Play > Join Game > Add Server button. How can I play with someone across networks? You need to port forward and share your IP with the other players. See the guide here. Consider using a public server, such as those that are on the game already. How do I set up a dedicated server? / How do I port forward? See this guide. Can PC players play with iOS/Android players? Yes, Mindustry is fully cross-platform. As long as all the devices are running the same version of Mindustry, any device can connect to any other device. How do I import a map? First of all, you need to make sure that the map is compatible with your game version. If you're running Mindustry 4.0 or later, you need a .msav map file. Once you download the file onto your device, open the Mindustry main menu. Select Editor -> Import Map (on the top of the screen). Find the directory that the map is in, select the file and press \"open\". Note that the file chooser will only display files with an .msav extension. If you can't find the file, make sure that you're looking in the right place and that the extension is correct. Note that Discord may sometimes remove the extension from files when downloading, so you'll need to open your file browser of choice and add the extension manually. How do I export a map file? Open your map in the editor. Open the menu, then press \"Export\". Select a directory, type in a filename and press \"Save\". I don't like the current version of Mindustry for some reason, what do I do? Just download Mindustry Classic for the old experience. It's identical to build 3.5 40, albeit with some minor bugfixes. PC/Android APK: https://anuke.itch.io/mindustry-classic You can also find it by searching \"mindustry classic\" on the Google Play store. Does Mindustry run on a Raspberry Pi? While the game itself could theoretically support it, no, it does not support the Raspberry Pi. However, the dedicated server will run on a Pi as long as you have the right version of Java installed. Note that the 3.5/Classic dedicated server will not run on a Pi; only 4.0 and above is supported. Where is the game's source code? On GitHub: https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry Did Anuke make the game alone? For the most part, yes. Music, graphics and programming are done by me. Translations are made by contributors from the community. Some people also contribute to the game's code by submitting pull requests on GitHub. These people are marked with a Contributor role on Discord. There are many people who contribute to the wiki/documentation as well. How do I join the Google Play beta program? Open the Google Play page for Mindustry, scroll to the bottom of the page and tap 'join beta'. Beta builds can take some time to become available after tapping the button. Be patient. I do not control how fast this happens; it is handled automatically by Google. I can't connect to servers / My game is out of date. What do I do? If you're using Google Play on Android, wait for an update to become available. Builds are usually updated before the announcement is made, but Google may take hours to process it. Be patient. If you're on iOS, it's the same deal, except you may need to wait a bit longer. iOS builds take a longer time to release, and Apple takes 1-2 days to verify each release even after they are uploaded. If you're using the desktop version, just go on itch.io using the links at the top of this channel and download the game again. Updating should not reset progress. Are Anuke and Anuken different people? They are very well the same person. Anuke(n) uses \"Anuken\" when \"Anuke\" is taken. I usually use Anuken when Anuke is taken as a username. -Anuken Why are you charging for the game on Steam and iOS when it is available for free? The game is being charged for on Steam and iOS because it is one way of supporting Anuke, and it has features not available on the free versions, such as: A map, mod, and schematic browser Secure, seamless multiplayer using Steam Multiplayer (eliminates the need to port-forward) Publicly visible servers at startup Achievements Stat tracking Cloud saves and progress transfer using Steam Steam community On the App Store, distributing the game there costs a lot, as a developer will need a Mac, and a $100/year developer license to do so. Such expenses are covered by charging for the game on there. How can I contribute to the game? The easiest way is to give constructive feedback and discussion (preferably about the game) in our Discord Server. Report bugs that you find on the GitHub repository. Please remember to use the templates properly , as doing so will make your issue more organized and follow a common pattern, making Anuke's job easier. If you know how to program in Java, feel free to help Anuke out and fix said bugs, then open a PR. Donations to Anuke are open on the Itch.io page if you would like to give a monetary contribution. You can also buy the game on Steam. If you are fluent in a language that Mindustry doesn't support yet, or if you want to contribute to the ones already there, stop by the #translations channel, and ask about it. You can contribute to the current bundles and open a PR in the game's repo. If you want to contribute to this wiki, please contact Anuke or Luxray5474.

There are many ways to use the modding API, depending on exactly what you want to do, and how far you're willing to go to do it. You could just resprite existing game content, you can create new game content with the simpler Json API (which is the main focus of this documentation), you can add custom sounds (or reuse existing ones). It's possible to add maps to campaign mode, and add scripts to program special behavior into your mod, like custom effects. Sharing your mod is as simple as giving someone your project directory; mods are also cross platfrom to any platform that supports them. Realistically speaking you'll want to use GitHub , you should also checkout the Example Mod repository on GitHub: https://github.com/Anuken/ExampleMod To make mods all you really need is any computer with a text editor. Directory Structure Your project directory should look something like this: project \u251c\u2500\u2500 mod.json \u251c\u2500\u2500 content \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 items \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 blocks \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 mechs \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 liquids \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 units \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 zones \u251c\u2500\u2500 maps \u251c\u2500\u2500 bundles \u251c\u2500\u2500 sounds \u251c\u2500\u2500 schematics \u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts \u251c\u2500\u2500 sprites-override \u2514\u2500\u2500 sprites mod.json (required) metadata file for your mod, content/* directories for game Content , maps/ directory for Zone maps, bundles/ directory for Bundles , sounds/ directory for Sound files, schematics/ directory for Schematic files, scripts/ directory for Scripts , sprites-override/ Sprites directory for overriding ingame content, sprites/ Sprites directory for your content, Every platform has a different user application data directory, and this is where your mods should be placed: Linux: ~/.local/share/Mindustry/mods/ Steam: steam/steamapps/common/Mindustry/mods/ Windows: %appdata%/Mindustry/mods/ Apple: ~/Library/Application Support/Mindustry/mods/ Note that your filenames should be lowercased and hyphen separated: correct: my-custom-block.json incorrect: My Custom Block.json Hjson Mindustry uses Hjson , which for anyone who knows Json, is simply a superset of the very popular serialization language known as Json . \u2013 This means that any valid Json will work, but you get extra useful stuff: # single line comment // single line comment /* multiline comment */ key1: single line string key2: ''' multiline string ''' key3: [ value 1 value 2 value 3 ] key4: { key1: string key2: 0 } If you don't know any of those words. \u2013 A serialization language, is simply a language which encodes information for a program, and encode means to translate informantion from one form to another, and in this case, to translate text into Java data structures. mod.json At the root of your project directory, you must have a mod.json which defines the basic metadata for your project. This file can also be (optionally) named mod.hjson to potentially help your text editor pick better syntax highlighting. name: Mod Name displayName: Mod [red]Name[] author: Yourself description: This is a useless description. version: \"1.0\" minGameVersion: \"100.3\" dependencies: [ ] name will be used to reference to your mod, so name it carefully; displayName this will be used as a display name for the UI, which you can use to add formatting to said name; description of the mod will be rendered in the ingame mod manager, so keep it short and to the point; dependencies is optional, if you want to know more about that, go to the dependencies section; minGameVersion is the minimum build version of the game. Content At the root of your project directory you can have a content/ directory, and this is where all the Json/Hjson data goes. Inside of content/ you have subdirectories for the various kinds of content, these are the current common ones: content/items/ for items , like copper and surge-alloy ; content/blocks/ for blocks , like turrets and floors; content/mechs/ for mechs , like tau and glaive ; content/liquids/ for liquids , like water and slag ; content/units/ for flying or ground units , like reaper and dagger ; content/zones/ for zones , configuration of campaign maps. Note that each one of these subdirectories needs a specific content type. The filenames of these files is important, because the stem name of your path (filename without the extension) is used to reference it. Furthermore the files within these content/<content-type>/* directories may be arbitrarly nested into other sub-directories of any name, to help you organize them further, for example: content/items/metals/iron.hjson , which would respectively create an item named iron . The content of these files will tend to look something like this: type: TypeOfThing name: Name Of Thing description: Description of thing. # ... more fields here ... field type notes type String Content type of this object. name String Displayed name of content. description String Displayed description of content. Other fields included will be the fields of the type itself. Types Types have numerous fields, but the important one is type ; this is a special field used by the content parser, that changes which type your object is. A Router type can't be a Turret type , as they're just completely different. Types extend each other, so if MissileBulletType extends BasicBulletType , you'll have access to all the fields of BasicBulletType inside of MissileBulletType like damage , lifetime and speed . Fields are case sensitive: hitSize =/= hitsize . What you can expect a field to do is up to the specific type, some types do absolutely nothing with their fields, and work mostly as a base types will extend from. One such type is Block . type can be refer to the actual type field of the object. A type may also refer to other things like float is a type so it means you can type 0.3 in a field. Here you can see, the type of the top level object is Revenant , but the type of the bullet is BulletType so you can use MissileBulletType , because MissileBulletType extends BulletType . type: Revenant weapon: { bullet: { type: MissileBulletType damage: 9000 } } Tech Tree Much like type there exist another magical field known as research which can go at the root of any block object to put it in the techtree. research: duo This would put your block after duo in the techtree, and to put it after your own mods block you would write your <block-name> , a mod name prefix is only required if you're using the content from another mod. Research cost will be 40 + round(requirements ^ 1.25) * 6 rounded down to the nearest 10 , where requirements is the build cost of your block. (in otherwords you can't set requirements and research cost individually) Sprites All you need to make sprites, is an image editor that supports transparency (aka: not paint). Block sprites should be 32 * size , so a 2x2 block would require a 64x64 image. Images must be .png files with 32 bit depth. Sprites can simply be dropped in the sprites/ subdirectory. The content parser will look through it recursively, so you can organize them how ever you feel. Content is going to look for sprites relative to it's own name. content/blocks/my-hail.json has the name my-hail and similarly sprites/my-hail.png has the name my-hail , so it'll be used by this content. Content may look for multiple sprites. my-hail could be a turret, and it could look for the suffix <name>-heat and what this means is it'll look for my-hail-heat . You can find all the vanilla sprites here: https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/tree/master/core/assets-raw/sprites Another thing to know about sprites is that some of them are modified by the game. Turrets specifically have a black border added to them, so you must account for that while making your sprites, leaving transparent space around turrets for example: Ripple To override ingame content sprites, you can simply put them in sprites-override/ . Sound Custom sounds can be added through the modding system by dropping them in the sounds/ subdirectory. It doesn't matter where you put them. Two formats are needed: .ogg required for Desktop/Android .mp3 required for iOS Just like any other assets, you reference them by the stem of your filenames, so pewpew.ogg and pewpew.mp3 can be referenced with pewpew from a field of type Sound . Here's a list of built-in sounds: artillery back bang beam bigshot boom break build buttonClick click conveyor corexplode door drill empty explosionbig explosion fire flame2 flame laserbig laser machine message missile pew place press release respawning respawn shootBig shoot shootSnap shotgun spark splash spray thruster unlock wave windowHide Dependencies You can add dependencies to your mod by simple adding other mods name in your mod.json : dependencies: [ other-mod-name not-a-mod ] The name of dependencies are lower-cased and spaces are replaced with - hyphens, for example Other MOD NamE becomes other-mod-name . To reference the other mods assets, you must prefix the asset with the other mods name: other-mod-name-not-copper would reference not-copper in other-mod-name other-mod-name-angry-dagger would reference angry-dagger in other-mod-name not-a-mod-angry-dagger would reference angry-dagger in not-a-mod Bundles An optional addition to your mod is called bundles. The main use of bundles are give translations of your content, but there's no reason you couldn't use them in English. These are plaintext files which go in the bundles/ subdirectory, and they should be named something like bundle_ru.properties (for Russian). The contents of this file is very simple: block.example-mod-silver-wall.name = \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0440\u044f\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0430 block.example-mod-silver-wall.description = \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0440\u0430. If you've read the first few sections of this guide, you'll spot it right away: <content type>.<mod name>-<content name>.name <content type>.<mod name>-<content name>.description Notes: mod/content names are lowercased and hyphen separated.

[name] sets the color by name, there's a few built-in colors ; [#rrggbb] / [#rrggbbaa] sets the color by hex value, with each value being anything from 00 to ff : rr is the red value, gg is the green value, bb is the blue value, aa is the alpha value; [] sets the color back to the previous color; [[ escapes the left bracket, so you can write [[red] to write and it'll render as [red] .

As of now, the only purpose of schematics is to give a zone a loadout. Scripts Scripting in Mindustry is done with the Rhino JavaScript runtime. Scripts may be added to your mod by putting them in scripts/ . Using the built-in extendContent function, you can extend existing Java types from JS, using allowed classes which are injected into your namespace. For example: scripts/silo.js // create a simple shockwave effect const siloLaunchEffect = newEffect(20, e => { // color goes from white to light gray Draw.color(Color.white, Color.lightGray, e.fin()); // line thickness goes from 3 to 0 Lines.stroke(e.fout() * 3); // draw a circle whose radius goes from 0 to 100 Lines.circle(e.x, e.y, e.fin() * 100); }); // create the block type const silo = extendContent(Block, \"scatter-silo\", { // override the method to build configuration buildConfiguration(tile, table) { table.addImageButton( Icon.arrowUpSmall, Styles.clearTransi, // configure the tile to signal that it has been // pressed (this sync on client to server) run(() => tile.configure(0)) ).size(50); }, // override configure event configured(tile, value) { // make sure this silo has the items it needs to fire if (tile.entity.cons.valid()) { // make this effect occur at the tile location Effects.effect(siloLaunchEffect, tile); // create 10 bullets at this tile's location with // random rotation and velocity/lifetime for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) { Calls.createBullet( Bullets.flakExplosive, tile.getTeam(), tile.drawx(), tile.drawy(), Mathf.random(360), Mathf.random(0.5, 1.0), Mathf.random(0.2, 1.0) ); } // triggering consumption makes it use up the // items it requires tile.entity.cons.trigger(); } } }); content/blocks/scatter-silo.hjson localizedName: \"Scatter Silo\" description: \"A player-activatable block that scatters bullets everywhere upon use.\" category: turret size: 2 update: true solid: true hasItems: true configurable: true requirements: [ \"graphite/75\" \"titanium/30\" ] consumes: { items: { items: [ \"scrap/10\" ] } } More examples: entity-lib GitHub Once you have a mod of some kind, you'll want to actually share it, and you may even want to work with other people on it, and to do that you can use GitHub . If you don't know what Git (or GitHub) is at all, then you should look into GitHub Desktop , otherwise simply use your favorite command line tool or text editor plugin. All you need understand is how to open repositories on GitHub, stage and commit changes in your local repository, and push changes to the GitHub repository. Once your project is on GitHub, there are three ways to share it: with the endpoint, for example Anuken/ExampleMod , which could then be typed in the ingame GitHub interface, and that would download it; with the zip file, for example https://github.com/Anuken/ExampleMod/archive/master.zip , which would download the repository as a zip file, and put in mod directory (unzipping is not required); add the typic/tags mindustry-mod on your repository, which should cause the #mods Discord bot to pick it up and render it in it's listh. FAQ time in game is calculated through ticks ; ticks sometimes called frames , are assumed to be 60/1 second; tilesize is 8 units internally; to calculate range out of lifetime and speed you can do lifetime * speed = range ; Abstract what is abstract ? all you need to know about abstract types, is this is a Java specific term, which means you cannot instantiate/initialize this specific type by itself. If you do so you'll probably get an \"initialization exception\" of some kind; what is a NullPointerException ? This is an error message that indicates a field is null and shouldn't be null, meaning one of the required fields may be missing; bleeding-edge what is bleeding-edge ? This is the developer version of Mindustry, specifically it's refering to the Github master branch. Changes on bleeding-edge usually make it into Mindustry in the next release. Change Log This is a log of changes done on the Mindustry Master branch that affected the modding API. The sections are ordered by date commited, and provide a description of what was changed, with a link to the diff on Github. 2020 Mar 5 [ commit Tech tree balance ] updated research cost formula Feb 11 [ commit improved battery brightness display ] added <name>-top region for battery; Jan 24 [ commit fixed #1436 / fixed crawlers not exploding ] added instantDisappear to BulletType ; Jan 23 [ commit implemented #1093 ] added attribute to ThermalGenerator ; Jan 22 [ commit added default ore flags for modded ores ] added oreDefault , oreThreshold and oreScale to Floor ; Jan 19 [ commit cleanup of scripts ] added killShooter attribute for BulletType ; Jan 14 [ commit visual tweaks ] added -spinner region to Separator ; removed spinnerRadius , spinnerLength , spinnerThickness , color from Separator ; Jan 08 [ commit make rebuildable a block attribute (#1338) ] added rebuildable to Block ; Jan 07 [ commit cleanup ] added drawCell , drawItems and drawLight to Mech ; Jan 04 [ commit merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/master' ] added targetDistance to Weapon ; Jan 03 [ commit use findAll to iterate through mod content ] content/ support for organizing .hjson files into directories; 2019 Dec 12 [ commit add liquid void block ] added LiquidVoid block; Dec 09 [ commit Removed unnecessary unit types ] changed unit types names: Draug \u2192 MinerDrone ; Spirit \u2192 RepairDrone ; Phantom \u2192 BuilderDrone ; [ Dagger Crawler Titan Fortress Eruptor ] \u2192 GroundUnit ; [ Wraith Ghoul ] \u2192 FlyingUnit ; Revenant \u2192 HoverUnit ; Dec 08 [ commit Merge branches master and rhino-js-suffering ] scripts/ sub-directory and Rhino JS runtime was added; displayName can now be used as field name in mod.json Dec 04 [ commit Added experimental server block syncing ] sync field for Block type was added; Nov 26 [ commit Texture overrides / Potential mod texture binding optimizations ] sprites-override/ subdirectory can now be used to override existing ingame sprites; Nov 22 [ commit Switched to hjson extension ] .hjson can now be used as a file extension; Nov 22 [ commit Added optional mod minimum game version ] minGameVersion can now be used within mod.json ; Nov 20 [ commit Better mod parsing ] liquid/amount can now be used as a string for LiquidStack ; item/amount can now be used as a string for ItemStack ; mod.json now supports hjson; World Block Extends BlockStorage Block is the base type of all blocks in the game.

Zone Extends Content A Zone is a type that takes a map (named the same as the json's filename) and puts it into campaign. (a zone isn't a map) Every Zone has a Generator , which once initialized, MapGenerator will run through the map and do initialization related stuff. One of those notable things, is deleting all cores on in your map and placing a loadout on top of a random one of them. This allows your campaign map to have multiple core locations. (it doesn't matter which core was previously on the map, loadout will dictate that) It is entirely possible to produce a custom schematic, but take note that this schematic must contain a CoreBlock within it. field type default notes baseLaunchCost [ ItemStack ] launchCost [ ItemStack ] startingItems [ ItemStack ] Items you start with on the map. conditionWave int alwaysUnlocked boolean false Whether this map is always unlocked launchPeriod int 10 Rate of waves at which the core may be launched. loadout Schematic basicShard Core layout placed by MapGenerators. resources [ String ] Array of item names. requirements [ Objective ] An array of requirements to unlock configuration. configureObjective Objective ZoneWave 15 defaultStartingItems [ ItemStack ] Sprites: zone-<name> preview <name>-zone preview Built-in loadouts: basicShard bXNjaAB4nD2K2wqAIBiD5ymibnoRn6YnEP1BwUMoBL19FuJ2sbFvUFgYZDaJsLeQrkinN9UJHImsNzlYE7WrIUastuSbnlKx2VJJt+8IQGGKdfO/8J5yrGJSMegLg+YUIA== advancedShard bXNjaAB4nD2LjQqAIAyET7OMIOhFfJqeYMxBgSkYCL199gu33fFtB4tOwUTaBCP5QpHFzwtl32DahBeKK1NwPq8hoOcUixwpY+CUxe3XIwBbB/pa6tadVCUP02hgHvp5vZq/0b7pBHPYFOQ= basicFoundation bXNjaAB4nD1OSQ6DMBBzFhVu8BG+0X8MQyoiJTNSukj8nlCi2Adbtg/GA4OBF8oB00rvyE/9ykafqOIw58A7SWRKy1ZiShhZ5RcOLZhYS1hefQ1gRIeptH9jq/qW2lvc1d2tgWsOfVX/tOwE86AYBA== basicNucleus bXNjaAB4nD2MUQqAIBBEJy0s6qOLdJXuYNtCgikYBd2+LNmdj308hkGHtkId7M4YFns4mk/yfB4a48602eDI+mlNznu0FMPFd0wYKCaewl8F0EOueqM+yKSLVfJrNKWnSw/FZGzEGXFG9sy/px4gEBW1 Built-in zones: nuclearComplexe desolateRift tarFields overgrowth stainedMountains frozenForest saltFlats desertWastes groundZero StatusEffect Extends Content Not be be confused with Effect , a status effect will give an entity special properties.

CacheLayer Flags used by for cache render: normal normal layer; walls walls layer; water water layer, adding tile water shaders, and giving wave reflections; tar tar layer, adding tar shaders, making it darker and giving it some bubble reflections; Entities BulletType Abstract type which extends Content BulletType can either be an object {} or a \"string\" , where a string would be reusing Built-in Bullets and an object would be making a custom one. There are two major categories of bullet types: BasicBulletType and, other special bullets. Here's an example of a custom bullet: { \"type\": \"MissileBulletType\", \"lifetime\": 1000, \"speed\": 2, \"splashDamageRadius\": 2, \"splashDamage\": 9, \"frontColor\": \"ffff00\", \"backColor\": \"00ffff\", \"homingPower\": 1, \"homingRange\": 20, \"fragBullets\": 3, \"fragBullet\": { \"type\": \"LiquidBulletType\", \"liquid\": \"oil\", \"lifetime\": 2, \"speed\": 1, \"fragBullets\": 2, \"fragBullet\": { \"type\": \"LiquidBulletType\", \"liquid\": \"slag\", \"lifetime\": 1, \"speed\": 2, \"damage\": 1, } } } field type default notes lifetime float amount of ticks the bullet will last speed float inital speed of bullet damage float collision damage hitSize float 4 collision radius drawSize float 40 drag float 0 decelleration per tick pierce boolean whether it can collide hitEffect Effect created when bullet hits something despawnEffect Effect created when bullet despawns shootEffect Effect created when shooting smokeEffect Effect created when shooting hitSound Sound made when hitting something or getting removed inaccuracy float 0 extra inaccuracy ammoMultiplier float 2 how many bullets get created per item/liquid reloadMultiplier float 1 multiplied by turret reload speed recoil float recoil from shooter entities killShooter float whether to kill the shooter when this is shot. (for suicide bombers) knockback float Knockback in velocity. hitTiles boolean true Whether this bullet hits tiles. status StatusEffect none Status effect applied on hit. statusDuration float 600 Intensity of applied status effect in terms of duration. collidesTiles boolean true Whether this bullet type collides with tiles. collidesTeam boolean false Whether this bullet type collides with tiles that are of the same team. collidesAir boolean true Whether this bullet type collides with air units. collides boolean true Whether this bullet types collides with anything at all. keepVelocity boolean true Whether velocity is inherited from the shooter. fragBullets int 9 Number of frag bullets created. fragVelocityMin float 0.2 Minimum random multiplier. fragVelocityMax float 1 Maximum random multiplier. fragBullet BulletType null The frag bullet that will be created, may be a string, an object or null. If field is null, no frag bullet is created. instantDisappear boolean Whether to instantly make the bullet disappear. (used in crawlers to make sure they explode) splashDamage float 0 Area of effect damage when the bullet despawns or hits a target. Damage is calculated with linear interpolation , also known as lerp. splashDamageRadius float -1 Use a negative value to disable splash damage. splashDamageRadius is a value used in the equation lerp(1 - distance / radius, 1, 0.4) which is a multiplier for splashDamage . incendAmount int 0 incendSpread float 8 incendChance float 1 homingPower float 0 Doesn't do anything complicated; if homingPower larger then 0.01 it gets rendered in the UI, if homingPower is larger then 0.0001 it allows homingRange to work. homingRange float 50 How close the bullet needs from a target in order to home/seek said target. lightining int lightningLength int 5 hitShake float 0 BasicBulletType Extends BulletType This types purpose is to give basic bullets their sprites. The bulletSprite will be used as the shape of the bullet. The visible pixels in your sprites will be tinted with backColor and frontColor respectively. For example if you had sprites router.png and router-back.png where Test Mod was your mods name, you could do this to include your bulletSprite : { \"type\": \"BasicBulletType\", \"bulletSprite\": \"test-mod-router\" } field type default bulletWidth float 5 bulletHeight float 7 bulletShrink float 0.5 Used to squishify the bullet as it gets closer to the target, where 0 is no shrink -0.5 is stretching and 0.5 is shrinking. frontColor Color bulletYellow Color of front sprite. backColor Color bulletYellowBack Color of back sprite. bulletSprite String bullet Mapping sprite used to make the shape of the bullet.

Structure"},{"location":"servers/","text":"Servers Servers are a large part of Mindustry in that they offer the ability to play the game with other people. There are two main types of servers; dedicated servers and local LAN servers. Dedicated Servers Dedicated servers are standalone, headless versions of the game that are focused only on providing a means for people to play Multiplayer. They are usually run on a computer as a separate program rather than in-game, and are operated from the terminal. These are usually stronger than a local LAN server as they have more resources available to them to support more than two or three players, and can be run 24/7. They are also more versatile and powerful in that they have many commands to provide the administrator with more control over it, and they can easily be modded to fit the administrator's needs. You can connect to one using the \"Join Game\" button under the \"Play\" menu. Unlike local LAN servers, you will have to enter the host's IP address and port. Also unlike local LAN servers, once you add a server, it will automatically show up on your server list when you open it, and the game will automatically check the server's status. To establish a dedicated server, a dedicated Linux or Windows machine is highly recommended. If you haven't already, install at least JRE and JDK 8. Download the desired server release from itch.io , or compile one yourself. Open a terminal or TTY session then change cd to the directory the JAR is placed in. Run java -jar server.jar using Command Prompt (on Windows) or your favorite terminal (on Linux and Mac). The commands are explained in the help command. Start hosting a map with host <mapname> [mode] after you configured your server. If you are using Windows to run your server, use your favorite search engine to look up how to add rules to your Windows Firewall, as it blocks that port most of the time. Make sure to allow port 6567 TCP and UDP . If you want your server to be publicly available around the world, then read the following. If not, then you are done! It is recommended and that you use a domain name or DNS service to mask your IP for public servers for ease of use, or even better, use a cloud service e.g. Amazon AWS or a dedicated server/VM from a hosting provider such as Linode or DigitalOcean, which is much safer. Do your research , and determine which option best fits your needs. What is an IP and how do I find out what mine is? In simplified terms, an IP address is a number that identifies your computer on the internet. You can connect to someone's Mindustry server if you know their IP address. There are two types; a public and a local address. For a local IP , when for example you would like to play with a friend on the same network as yours, each device has its own way of showing it. You can Google how to do it for your device, e.g. \"find local ip on Mac\". For a public IP , you can simply Google \"what is my ip\". About Running A Dedicated Server At Home Most of the time, this is what you should remember; never share your public IP with the public if you're hosting from your home, unless you acknowledge the implications of doing so! Your public IP is tied to your household, and if it falls into the wrong hands, and when put into the wrong hands, can open up your network to vulnerabilities and dangers. Exercise caution, do your research, and use a VPN or webhost if possible. Find the make/model of your router. This is usually on a sticker on the bottom or back of the router. Use your favorite search engine to search \"port forward ASUS RT-ACRH17\" and use the guide to foward port 6567 TCP and UDP . These instructions are different for every router, so be sure to read your guide thoroughly! You can use a service such as You Get Signal to check if you have done your portforwarding correctly. Local LAN & Steam Servers A local LAN or Steam server is a server that is built into the game, and can be started using the \"Host Multiplayer Game\" button in the in-game menu. It is meant to be simple and straightforward, for sessions between a few players under a LAN network (aka in your household's WiFi network). It is not really meant for several players, as it takes more and more resources from your device to be able to use it that way; for that you will need a dedicated server mentioned above. It can only run when the game is open, and is immediately terminated when it is closed. You can connect to one using the \"Join Game\" button under the \"Play\" menu. Unlike dedicated servers, your device will automatically find the host device and it will ususally appear in the server list without you having to enter the host's IP address in.","title":"Servers"},{"location":"servers/#servers","text":"Servers are a large part of Mindustry in that they offer the ability to play the game with other people.

Manual Editing Manual editing involves using a text editor such as Notepad++, Vim, or Visual Studio Code to edit your code. For more advanced users and longer code, manual editing is the way to go .

Some instructions can only accept whole numbers, so it is indicated accordingly in this manual. String An Object that represents text enclosed in quotes, e.g. \"hello mindustry\" Building An Object that represents a physical Building in a world. This is different from a Block ; a Block is simply a type of Building, but a Building is a tangible Block - as in, it has health, interacts with power and items, etc. Essentially, a Building is a Block that physically exists in a world. For example, the getlink instruction will return a Building Object, which you can get information about using sensor . Unit An Object that represents a Unit in a world, including the player. For example, the ubind instruction will set a processor variable @unit to a Unit Object representing a bound unit.

This is both a guide and a reference for Mindustry Logic. It contains both basic and advanced information relating to the language. This manual is designed to be comprehensive to all levels of programming, and we're trying to make it understood by people who don't even know what code is. What is Mindustry Logic? Mindustry Logic (mlog) is a scripting language added in v6 for the purpose of introducing more advanced automation and strategy into the game. It is heavily inspired by Assembly languages, where there is only one instruction or operation at a time. This is quite unlike more popular languages such as Python, Java, or C++, where you have convenient ways to create one-liners, functions, conditional statements, loops, and classes. The current capabilities of the language are: * Getting information about blocks and units, including the player * Controlling buildings and turrets * Controlling and writing/reading information to/from units * Displaying shapes and colors in displays * Outputting text through message blocks * Reading and writing information to and from memory cells * Reading player input through switch blocks * Mathematical operations, both unary and binary * And much more! What do I need before I get into Mindustry Logic? A good thing to have beforehand is some programming experience, at least in regards to concepts and theory. This can help with understanding some of the techniques and concepts of this language. But most importantly, you need patience and an open mind , since a lot can change between updates and many things may seem daunting and complex until you try them out. You might also want to have Google on hand if you don't understand specific programming terms used here. Why is everyone rude in #logic on the Discord? Most of the time it's just because the answer to your question is in very close reach, and all you need is to install this manual or read it better. All if not most of the time, all you need to do is RTFM (read this fabulous manual) thoroughly, and you will find your answer. If you're absolutely sure it isn't covered here, you are welcome to ask a question in #logic. How to ask an effective question: * First, try to figure it out with the help of this manual or Google . Include what you've tried and already know. * Please DO NOT post extremely frequently asked questions such as \"how do I control turret\" or \"how to make unit move\". Again, you can find your answers here. * Ask in detail so anybody who helps you has all the context they need to do so effectively. We try our best not to be rude or impolite, but questions that don't go by those standards can test our patience, especially if the solution is simple and covered by the manual. It's a waste of someone's time to ask them about a question that's already written clearly in the manual. Examples of acceptable question structure and spirit: * \"Hey after reading the manual, I can't understand what exactly a double is. Can't I just use an int?\" * \"I'm having trouble with radar. It doesn't detect my player even though I'm in range of the turret. Here is my code:\" * \"Why can't I print a string and a variable properly in the same print instruction?\" It's inevitable that not everybody can do that all of the time, so try your best to make your question presentable at the very least, and follow at least one of these guidelines.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"logic/Introduction/#introduction","text":"Welcome to the official Mindustry Logic manual.
