# Getting Started

It's 2020 and logic is here! With it, you can control arcane magics, command your units even more, and even play *geometry dash* in Mindustry!

---------------

Logic blocks can be found in the bottom right corner of the build menu.

( insert several images here & below )

There are several new buildings here, but for now, all you need to place is a small processor and a message block.

Clicking on the processor, you'll notice a pencil mark popup appear below the procesor: clicking that will let you start creating code.
You can also click on blocks near the processor to *link* them to the processor and run code on them. For now, click on the message box - 
if you see "message1" appear above the message block, you've done it right.

Now for the fun part - click on the pencil below the processor, this will bring you to a new menu with 3 buttons.
Click on "Add" and click on "Print", and also get "Printflush".
If you now exit from the processor, you'll see that the message block now says "frog"!

(man this took a long time and idk what should be next, operations, draw or sensor)

(I may have taken absolute beginners a bit literally and my grasp of the english language isn't that fine, but oh well)
(is this too step by step or is it okay)
