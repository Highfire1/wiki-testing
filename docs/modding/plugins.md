# Plugins

Plugins are Java mods that are intended to be run on servers only. Usually, these add *new commands* or *new gamemodes*. 

You can see an example plugin [here](https://github.com/Anuken/ExamplePlugin). For a more practical example that can be used on real servers, see [this repo](https://github.com/Anuken/AuthorizePlugin).
