**Welcome to the official Wiki for [Mindustry](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry)!**

//TODO links to trello, github, steam, etc - similar to the readme
//TODO link to readme for actual building and contribution guidelines - don't put them here

**Contribution is highly encouraged.**

If you find anything in the game that is not listed in these articles and would like to help, please feel free to hop onto the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/MindustryGame/wiki) and open a Pull Request with the changes. The majority of the wiki, however, is **autogenerated**, meaning that you should instead open a Pull Request on the game's repository or on the [WikiGen repository](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry-Wiki-Generator) if the issue concerns those pages.

# Getting Started

Getting started with Mindustry is easy. This article covers how to install Mindustry on different platforms and situations. 

## Typical Setup

For **PC, Mac, and Linux**, you can get the game on [itch.io](https://anuke.itch.io/mindustry), [GitHub]() or [Steam.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127400/Mindustry/)

For **Android**, you can get the game on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.anuke.mindustry) or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.anuke.mindustry/), which updates slightly slower.

For **iOS**, you can buy it on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mindustry/id1385258906?ign-mpt=uo%3D8). Note that iOS builds don't update as often as builds for other platforms.

If you want the **bleeding edge (BE) builds** that are created for every commit, download them on the [MindustryBuilds GitHub repository.](https://github.com/Anuken/MindustryBuilds/releases) These builds work on all platforms *except for iOS.*
